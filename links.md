2. [MAN command in Linux with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
Explains the man command, which in my opinion is a highly underrated command that is useful for studying about any Linux commands,
especially when you don't know where to start/forget what flags you can use for the command.

3. [The Linux command line for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)
In my opinion this is a very useful guide for someone who's never used/is not used to the Linux CLI before. It teaches readers the history of the Linux command line,
how to access a CLI from your computer, and also some basic commands including but not limited to file manipulation, pipes, stdout, and superuser/sudo.

4. [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)

useful basic examples including one for backing up a folder into a tarball.
