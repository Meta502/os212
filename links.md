1. [AWK command in Unix/Linux with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/)
Explains the basics of how to use the Awk command, complete with an explanation of what Awk is, what it can be used for, and examples on how to use it.

2. [MAN command in Linux with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
Explains the man command, which in my opinion is a highly underrated command that is useful for studying about any Linux commands,
especially when you don't know where to start/forget what flags you can use for the command.
