1. [AWK command in Unix/Linux with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/)
Explains the basics of how to use the Awk command, complete with an explanation of what Awk is, what it can be used for, and examples on how to use it.

2. [MAN command in Linux with examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
Explains the man command, which in my opinion is a highly underrated command that is useful for studying about any Linux commands,
especially when you don't know where to start/forget what flags you can use for the command.

3. [The Linux command line for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)
In my opinion this is a very useful guide for someone who's never used/is not used to the Linux CLI before. It teaches readers the history of the Linux command line,
how to access a CLI from your computer, and also some basic commands including but not limited to file manipulation, pipes, stdout, and superuser/sudo.

4. [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)
A short intro to shell scripting in Linux. This is quite useful for transitioning from Python scripting (which most of us are used to from DDP1) to shell scripting using sh/bash, with some
useful basic examples including one for backing up a folder into a tarball.
